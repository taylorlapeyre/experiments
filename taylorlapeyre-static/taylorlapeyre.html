<h1>My Initial Impressions of Ruby</h1>

<p>
After working with Ruby for a while to test out a few things, I've developed quite an affinity for the little language. Everything I code in it seems to <em>look</em> right, almost (and I'm paraphrasing the great John Ives here) "as if it was meant to be that way. Like of course it is. What other way could it be?" For instance, in this Ruby class file, everything seems perfectly placed:
</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/3006087.js?file=Weight.rb"></script>

<p>
I've discovered that ruby code goes to a level of abstraction in code that I've never really looked at before. Things like <code>0.upto 10</code> and <code>10.times</code> seem like such simple things to ask for in a language that it's confusing that nobody else has really implemented things that well before. Anyway, I'm still looking at all the aspects of Ruby that I can grasp. But for the moment, it looks like I've really found something that I'm comfortable in.
</p>

<p>
One final example of how concise ruby code can be:

<h1>Reflections after New York</h1>

<p>
It has really only been a couple days since I got back from New York. I still can't really stop thinking about living there (or more specifically, if I could live there). I've really been fascinated with the idea of living in an apartment. Riding a bike to work or wherever. "Living off the land." It's fascinating. I want to be able to not feel tied down to a permanent house or a permanent car or whatever it may be. And I guess that's the real truth of it, that I like the idea of living off of temporary, yet worthwhile and dependable, things and services. 
</p>

<p>
It's partially why I'm so excited to move back to Baton Rouge for school. To have my own little room in an apartment… it would be wonderful. I just wish that I wasn't so far away from campus so that I could bike to school every day! Of course, I'd need a bike for that, wouldn't I? That's another thing. Why is it that all of the things that I find so enjoyable and interesting are so expensive? Perhaps I just have expensive taste in stuff. Like $200 jeans. Ha. Everybody gets a kick out of that. And maybe they aren't too wrong in laughing.
</p>

<p>
Somebody on the internet came up with such a great thought on the idea of minimalism. Specifically that "minimalists" are really just as materialistic as normal people, but instead of talking about how much stuff they have they simply talk about how much stuff they don't have. "It's like talking about how awesome it is to not collect stamps," he said. There's a lot of truth behind that.

<h1>Finding a good CMS</h1>

<p>
I really can’t decide if I like the whole idea of using a CMS. It may be that I’m fairly new to the concept, but I just don’t really understand how using something that is made with another person’s vision in mind would help me create a unique website that is perfect for my needs. There’s just something about opening up a blank text editor and typing away CSS and HTML code until it’s perfect that I really love.
</p>

<p>
But then again, as so many people have obviously realized, there isn’t really a point to “reinventing the wheel” again and again. Part of me likes the idea of building a personal library of code that I can reuse, but another part of me thinks that somewhere out there, there’s a CMS that has the perfect amount of simplicity for me to be able to use it for whatever I want - and not just a blog. One that I’ve found recently is <a href="#">Visual Idiot</a>’s personal project, <a href="#">Anchor</a>. I haven’t tested it out yet, but it seems like the guy has a clear focus for the project - a simple CMS that is focused on creative blogs. I like that idea - especially since most of the CMSs that I’ve tried seem to be entirely too bogged down with features to really provide a clean interface for writing, etc.

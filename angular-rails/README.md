#### Angular + Rails

This application combines both [angularjs][ng] and [Rails][rails] into one integrated application.

**Rails** uses angular for displaying the site's content and for navigation. **Angular** uses rails for its asset pipeline and as an api endpoint for the data that it displays.

[ng]: http://angularjs.org/
[rails]: http://rubyonrails.org/

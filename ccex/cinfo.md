# Consignor Guidelines

You are paid 50% of the selling price. Consignor proceed checks are available on Pickup Day. Unclaimed checks after Pickup Day will be mailed.

Clothes may not have stains, holes, rips, tears, missing buttons, broken zippers, or pilling. Inspect your items carefully; unacceptable items will be immediately donated to charity during the pricing period without consultation with consignor. You will find this policy repeated in our guidelines as it is our most valuable quality control measure.

Consignors are responsible for item tagging. Each consignor is assigned a number and given tags and tagging equipment. We will show you how to properly tag your items - just ask us!. A limited number of home processing kits are available (details further down the page). We have updated the website to include the instruction process.

CCEX prices all clothing. Consignors are responsible for pricing all toys and equipment (including games, books, etc.).

As a courtesy, please avoid coming just before closing time during receiving - especially if you have a large number of items to tag. We have over thirty hours of receiving time spread over a week for your convenience and ours. While we are always careful, we cannot assume responsibility for loss, theft or damage to your item.

A tip for all you Moms with baby clothes - Bring in your infant items as soon as you can during our receiving days. Infant clothes and equipment are for sale throughout the sale, from the first receiving Sunday until the last day of the sale. The sooner your clothes are available, the faster they'll sell!

Unsold items, along with your check for items sold, may be picked up ONLY during the hours listed on the day designated as PICKUP DAY. NO PHONE CALLS will be made as reminders. Items not picked up by the end of the business day become the property of CCEX and will be donated to charity. You will receive a tax donation form if you choose to donate your items. If you are unable to pick up your check, your check and a donation form will be mailed to you.

### If you are an experienced consignor and wish to tag at home:

We prefer you to prepare your items in the shop during receiving, although we’re happy to have you tag your items at home. We have a limited number of tagging guns available for this purpose, so please remember you may keep the tagging kit overnight. **If a tagging gun is not returned after five days, a $20 deduction from your consignment proceeds will be taken.**

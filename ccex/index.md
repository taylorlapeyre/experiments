Welcome to the CHILDREN'S CLOTHING EXCHANGE! We are a fantastic consignment sale that you won’t want to miss! Our sale is held twice a year – Spring and Fall - in New Orleans, LA. The Children’s Clothing Exchange (CCEX) gives you the opportunity to SELL and/or BUY fine quality “used but not abused” infant through pre-teen children’s clothing, baby equipment, toys and furniture.

Holly Lapeyre and Ann McKendrick are the co-owners of CCEX. They are the fourth set of moms to own the business in its over 30 year history in the New Orleans area. They bought the business in 2003 after consigning their own children’s clothing for many years. In the nine years that they have run CCEX, the business has grown tremendously in both shoppers and consignors and has quite a following in the area. We look forward to seeing you at our next sale!

Please feel free to contact Holly at (504) 905-5778 or Ann at (504) 865-7481 to have your CCEX questions answered.

**Our Fall 2013 sale will be held at:**

Valencia Club

# Frequently Asked Questions

The following frequently asked questions are meant to guide you to a successful experience with Children's Clothing Exchange.

### I am new to the sale, what do I do?

*   **We have two sales each year** – Fall and fall, so gather your items (fall/winter or Fall/summer) that you wish to sell at the appropriate seasonal sale. You are welcome to also just come and shop if you have nothing to sell.

*   **Consignors are responsible for tagging all of their items.**  We have all the equipment, tags and hangers that you will need to do this.  We will walk you through the process and answer all your questions when you come in.

*   **We use two colors of tags, yellow and white.** Yellow tags indicate that an item will be donated to charity at the end of the sale. White tags are used for items that consignors will pick up at the end of the sale.

*   **Consignors will receive a unique number** which you will put on all of your items.   After they are tagged and hung, you simply place the clothing on the racks in the right size. Items sold are credited to your number, so make sure it is on every tagged item.

*   **Please allow yourself a sufficient amount of time to tag the items that you bring in.**  We suggest at least an hour or two – especially if you have never tagged clothing before.

### Do I need an appointment or do I just drop off my items?

**No**, you do not need an appointment.  We are open for one week to take in the items that you wish to sell.  We have over thirty hours of receiving time spread over the week for your convenience and ours – this includes two weekend days and one weeknight.

### Do we price our own items?

*   **CCEX prices all of the clothing that you bring in.**  We do this so that we can keep the prices consistent.  We have an extensive pricing guide that takes into account different brands and condition of clothing.
*   **You price the following:** Toys, games, baby equipment, bedding, books or DVDs.  We suggest that you ask about half of what the items sold for at the time you bought it or simply try and think of what you would want to pay for the item if you came in our store to buy it.  Remember, the better an item looks, the better it sells, so clean up it and put in fresh batteries!  NO ONE WILL BUY AN ITEM THAT DOESN’T WORK.

### How much do we earn as a consignor?

**Consignors make 50%** of the selling price of each item sold.  **We do not charge any fees to participate in our sale.**   Additionally, we provide ALL the items that you will need from tags to tape, Ziploc bags and hangers.

### When do we pick up our checks?

**Your checks will be ready on Pickup Day.** At the same time, you will pick up your items that didn’t sell, or choose to donate them to charity.  **We DO NOT make any reminder calls to come and get your items.**  If you do not come to pick up your items, they will be donated to charity and your check, with a tax donation form, will be mailed to you within one week.

### Do you have take home kits so that we can tag our items at home?

**Yes.** We have a very limited number of take home kits that are available for overnight check out.  If you have never participated in our sale before as a consignor, we ask that you come into the store so that we can show you the correct way to tag your items.

### Is there a certain number of items that I have to bring in?

**No.** We do not have a minimum or maximum number of items that you need to consign. You do not need to consign in order to shop at our consignment sale.

### Are there any items that you don’t accept?

**Yes.** We do ask that you review our website for a list of items that we do not accept.  We strongly suggest that you not bring in any “Gerber” type onsies or t-shirts.  They just DO NOT SELL.  If you can buy them 3 for $5 at the store brand new, they just don’t sell at a consignment store.  We suggest that you donate those items to charity.

### When can I start buying?

*   **Immediately** _(during receiving)_: Infant clothing, up to 24 months, toys, baby equipment and boys blazers.  We also have two Early Infant Shopping Days where the same items are available. Check the calendar for the dates.
*   **First Selling Saturday:** All other sizes, 2-teen, plus the items above.  Check the website for all of the dates.  Remember, you do not need to consign anything in order to shop.

Please note our selling dates. These are the only times that customers are able to shop, and we cannot make exceptions.

Children are welcome at all times.

**We prefer to accept cash and checks, however, we will accept credit cards with a small service charge.** Sales are subject to sales tax. Items are sold “as is”, with no assurances or guarantees. **All sales are final once the tag is cut.** No exchanges or returns.

**Infant clothing through size 24 months, furniture/equipment, boys’ blazers size 6-16, and toys may be purchased on all Receiving and Selling days including Infant Sale day.**
